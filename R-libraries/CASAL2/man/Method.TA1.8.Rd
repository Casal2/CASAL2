\usage{
Method.TA1.8(model, observation_labels, plot.it = F, xlim = NULL,
  ylim = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Casal2 output that is the result of a -r, -e run.}

\item{observation_labels}{vector<string> Labels of the observations you want to apply the iterative weighting too, can be multiple datasets as in in Chris's original package multiple = T.}

\item{plot.it}{If TRUE, plot the index and the smoothed fit. Otherwise, return a dataframe of the year, index, smoothed fitted value, and cv)}

\item{xlim}{x-axis limits for the illustrative plot}

\item{ylim}{y-axis limits for the illustrative plot}
}
\value{
Outputs a mutiplier, w, so that N2y = w x N1y, where N1y and N2y are the stage-1 and stage-2 multinomial sample sizes for the data set in year y.
}
\description{
This function is useful for deciding on the data weights of one or more at-age or at-length data sets with assumed multinomial error structure in a stock assessment. Can produce a diagnostic plot if the analysis is for a single data set
