\usage{
extract.mcmc(samples.file = "mcmc_samples.out.0",

  return_covariance = F, fileEncoding = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{samples.file}{<string> the name of the input file containing the samples.file output by casal2}

\item{objectives.file}{<string> the name of the input file containing the objectives.file output by casal2}

\item{path}{Optional<string>, the path to the file}

\item{return_covariance}{Optional<bool>, Whether you want to extract the covariance matrix with the mcmc object?}

\item{fileEncoding}{Optional, allows the R-library to read in files that have been encoded in alternative UTF formats, see the manual for the error message that would indicate when to use this switch.}
