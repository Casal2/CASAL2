Contributors checklist
======================

This is a check list for collaborators, who would like to make 
changes to the master repository. There is an expected standard of 
coding practice which is the google C++ standard see here for more 
information https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html. 

Once you have made changes to the code, you should check that you 
have done the following checks before you submit a "pull request"

- Filled out all the documentation and put your name on the source 
  files created
- Have successfully compiled the code with doBuild.bat "debug", 
  "release" and "archive" under the BuildSystem directory
- Check the unit tests have all passed. This involves compiling 
  the unit tester "doBuild.bat test" then running "casal2" with the 
  resulting executable.
- Run the model runner "doBuild.bat Modelrunner"

Once these have bbeen succesfully completed, and all errors or issues 
have been resolved, the resulting changes can be submitted to the 
Development Team
