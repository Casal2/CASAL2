This is a check list for collaborators, who would like to make changes to the master repository. There is an expected standard of coding practice which is the google C++ standard see here for what that means https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html. Once you have made changes to the code base, you should check that you have done the following checks before you submit a "pull request"

- Filled out all the documnetation and put your name on the source files created
- Have successfully compiled the code with doBuild.bat "debug", "release" and "archive" under the BuildSystem directory
- Check the unit tests have all passesd. This involves compiling the unit tester "doBuild.bat test" then running "casal2" with the resulting executable.
- Run the model runner "doBuild.bat Modelrunner"
- Now do a pull request 

Thankyou very much in advanced from the development team =)
