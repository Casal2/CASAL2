	However, routine use of Gibbs sampling has been hampered by the lack
	of general purpose software for its implementation. Until now all
	applications have involved writing one-off computer code in low or
	intermediate level languages such as C or FORTRAN. We describe some
	general purpose software that we are currently developing for implementing
	Gibbs sampling: BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling). The
	BUGS system comprises three components: first, a natural language
	for specifying complex models; second, an expert system for deciding
	appropriate methods for obtaining samples required by the Gibbs sampler;
	third, a sampling module containing numerical routines to perform
	the sampling. S objects are used for data input and output. BUGS
	is written in modula-2 and runs under both DOS and UNIX.},

   Number = {9},
   Pages = {1128-1140},
   Abstract = {This paper presents a new comprehensive growth model which includes numerous historical models as special cases. The new model is derived from a concise biological principle which, unlike earlier theories, relates to growth acceleration . Properties of growth curves, such as asymptotic limits or inflection points, are shown to be incidental in this new context. Possible submodels include not only asymptotic growth (such as von Bertalanffy, Richards, Gompertz, or logistic growth) but also linear, quadratic, or exponential growth. By simple analysis of variance, the observed data can be used directly in deciding which type of model is most appropriate. The new model is cast in terms of parameters which have stable statistical estimates. From this perspective, it is shown how earlier formulations sometimes result in an endless computer search for optimal parameter estimates.},
