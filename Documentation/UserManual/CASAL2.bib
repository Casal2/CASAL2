	general purpose software that we are currently developing for implementing
	Gibbs sampling: BUGS (Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling). The
	BUGS system comprises three components: first, a natural language
	for specifying complex models; second, an expert system for deciding
	appropriate methods for obtaining samples required by the Gibbs sampler;
	third, a sampling module containing numerical routines to perform
	the sampling. S objects are used for data input and output. BUGS
	is written in modula-2 and runs under both DOS and UNIX.},

   Number = {9},

   Abstract = {This paper presents a new comprehensive growth model which includes numerous historical models as special cases. The new model is derived from a concise biological principle which, unlike earlier theories, relates to growth acceleration . Properties of growth curves, such as asymptotic limits or inflection points, are shown to be incidental in this new context. Possible submodels include not only asymptotic growth (such as von Bertalanffy, Richards, Gompertz, or logistic growth) but also linear, quadratic, or exponential growth. By simple analysis of variance, the observed data can be used directly in deciding which type of model is most appropriate. The new model is cast in terms of parameters which have stable statistical estimates. From this perspective, it is shown how earlier formulations sometimes result in an endless computer search for optimal parameter estimates.},

	abstract = {Casal2 (pronounced Casal-two) has replaced CASAL, New Zealand’s integrated fish stock assessment package since 2002. Casal2 replicates most of CASAL’s functions such as many stocks, fisheries, and areas; age- or length-based dynamics; the use of several data sources (e.g., abundance indices, age frequencies, and tagging), but it has been extended into a generalised modelling tool and it uses more efficient programming practices and tools than CASAL. CASAL has enabled a more efficient use of resources for stock assessments, such as allowing a wider range of staff to conduct assessments, helped communication between members of the Assessment Working Groups, enabling a focus on fits of the models and model structure since standardised methods meant that model components were known and rigorous testing ensured confidence that the code base was validated. Design decisions taken at an early stage in CASAL’s development now limit its expansion. Re-coding CASAL was New Zealand’s best option to retain the benefits of CASAL and to control its own destiny over progress in new stock assessment techniques, such as easy use in management strategy evaluations. We have replicated many CASAL assessments successfully and so will release the first version of Casal2 in 2016 as an open source package under the GPL-2.0 licence. A pre-release download of an executable, draft manual, examples, and source code are available from ftp://ftp.niwa.co.nz/Casal2/windows/Casal2.zip.},
