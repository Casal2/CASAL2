\section{Running \CNAME\label{sec:running}\index{Running \CNAME}}

\CNAME\ is run from a console window (i.e., the command line) on \I{Microsoft Windows} or from a terminal window on \I{Linux}. \CNAME\ uses information from input data files -{}- the \emph{\config\index{Input configuration file}} being the main input file.

The \config\ is required and defines the model structure and processes, the observations and parameters (both the fixed parameters and the parameters to be estimated)\index{Estimable parameters}, and the reports (outputs) requested.

The following sections  describe how to construct the \CNAME\ configuration file. By convention, the name of the \config\ ends with the suffix \texttt{.csl2}. However, any file name is acceptable. Note that the \config\ can include other files as a part of its syntax. Collectively, these are called the \config.

Other input files can be included depending on the run mode and what information is required. For example, an input file can define the initial parameter values for estimation, or values from which to simulate observations, or values from which to run projections.

Command line arguments\index{Command line arguments} are used to specify the actions or \emph{tasks}\index{Tasks} of \CNAME, e.g., to run a model with a set of parameter values, to estimate parameter values (either point estimates or MCMC), to project quantities, or to simulate observations. Hence, the \emph{command line arguments} define the \emph{task}. For example, \texttt{-r} is the \emph{run} mode, \texttt{-e} is the \emph{estimation} mode, and \texttt{-m} is the \emph{MCMC} mode. The \emph{command line arguments} are described in Section \ref{sec:command-line-arguments}.

\subsection{\I{Using \CNAME}}

To use \CNAME, open a console window (i.e. the command prompt) window on Microsoft Windows or a terminal window on Linux. Navigate to the directory where the model \config s are located. Then enter \cname\ with arguments for a specific mode to start the \CNAME\ mode running; see Section \ref{sec:command-line-arguments} for the list of possible arguments. \CNAME\ will print output to the screen.

The \CNAME\ executable and shared libraries (files with extension \texttt{.dll} or \texttt{.so}) must either be in the same directory as the \config s or in one of the directories in your operating system's \texttt{PATH} environment variable. The \CNAME\ installer will update \texttt{PATH}; see your operating system documentation for help displaying or modifying \texttt{PATH}.

\subsection{The \config\label{sec:config-files}}\index{Input configuration file}

The \config\ is made up of four broad sections:

\begin{itemize}
	\item the description of the population structure and parameters (the population section),
	\item the estimation methods and estimated variables (the estimation section),
	\item the observations and their associated properties and likelihoods (the observation section), and
	\item the output values and reports that \CNAME\ will output (the report section).
\end{itemize}

The \config\ is made up of a number of commands, many with subcommands, which specify various options for each of these components.

The command and subcommand definitions in the \config\ can be extensive, particularly if you have a model that has many partitions or timesteps, and can result in a \config\ that is long and difficult to navigate.

To aid in making the model configuration more readable and flexible, the \config\ command \texttt{!include "\emph{filename}"} can be used (Figure~\ref{fig:config_file_1}). This command specifies that another file, \argument{filename}, be read and processed, exactly as if its contents had been inserted into the main \config\ at that point\index{Including external files}. The file name must be the complete file name with extension, and can use either the relative or absolute path as part of its name. Included files can also contain \texttt{!include} commands. See Section \ref{sec:general-syntax} for more detail.

	 "\argument{filename}".}}\label{fig:config_file_1}
\end{figure}
%\vspace*{1mm}

\subsection{\I{Redirecting standard output}\label{sec:redirecting-stdout}}

\CNAME\ uses the \texttt{standard output}\index{standard output} stream to display runtime information. The \I{standard error} stream is used by \CNAME\ to output the program exit status and runtime errors. We suggest redirecting both the standard output and standard error into files\index{Redirecting standard out}\index{Redirecting standard error}.

With the bash shell (on Linux systems), you can do this using the command structure

\begin{verbatim} (casal2 [arguments] > run.out) >& run.err &\end{verbatim}

It may be useful to redirect the standard input, especially if you're using \CNAME\ inside a batch job, i.e.

\begin{verbatim} (casal2 [arguments] > run.out < /dev/null) >& run.err &\end{verbatim}

On Microsoft Windows systems, you can redirect to standard output using

\begin{verbatim} casal2 [arguments] > run.out\end{verbatim}

And, on some Microsoft Windows systems (e.g., Windows 10), you can redirect to both standard output and standard error, using the syntax

\begin{verbatim} casal2 [arguments] > run.out 2> run.err\end{verbatim}

\CNAME\ outputs header information to the output (Figure~\ref{fig:log_file_1}). The header\index{Output header information} consists of the program name and version, the arguments passed to \CNAME\ from the command line, the date and time that the program was called (derived from the system time), the user name, and the machine name (including the operating system and the process identification number). This information can be used to track outputs as well as identifying the version of \CNAME\ used to run the model.

	\caption{\textbf{Example of output file header information.}}\label{fig:log_file_1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\I{Command line arguments}\label{sec:command-line-arguments}}

\CNAME\ is called using:

\texttt{\cname [-c \emph{config\_file}] [\emph{task}] [\emph{options}]}

where

\begin{description}
  \item [\texttt{-c \emph{config\_file}}] Define the \config\ for \CNAME\ (if this argument is omitted, the default \config\ is \texttt{config.csl2})
\end{description}

and where \emph{task} must be one of the following (\textbf{[]} indicates a secondary label to call the task, e.g. \textbf{\texttt{-h}} will execute the same task as \textbf{\texttt{-{}-help}}),

\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{-h [-{}-help]}] Display help (this page)
\item [\texttt{-l [-{}-licence]}] Display the reference for the software license (GPL v2)
\item [\texttt{-v [-{}-version]}] Display the \CNAME\ version number

\item [\texttt{-r [-{}-run]}] \emph{Run} the model once using the parameter values in the \config, or optionally with the starting parameter values from the file specified with argument \texttt{-i \emph{filename}}

\item [\texttt{-f [-{}-projection]}] Project the model \emph{forward} in time using the parameter values in the \config\ as the starting point for the estimation, or optionally with the starting parameter values from the file specified with the argument \texttt{-i \emph{filename}}

\item [\texttt{-s [-{}-simulation]} \emph{number}] \emph{Simulate} the \emph{number} of observation sets using values in the \config\ as the parameter values, or optionally with the parameter values from the file specified with the argument \texttt{-i \emph{filename}}
\end{description}

and where the following optional arguments\index{Optional command line arguments} [\emph{options}] may be specified

\begin{description}
\item [\texttt{-i [-{}-input] \emph{filename}}] \emph{Input} one or more sets of free (estimated) parameter values from \texttt{\emph{filename}} (see Section \ref{sec:report-syntax} for details about the format of \texttt{\emph{filename}})

\item [\texttt{-o [-{}-output]\emph{filename}}] \emph{Output} a report of the free (estimated) parameter values in a format suitable for \texttt{-i \emph{filename}} (see Section \ref{sec:report-syntax} for details about the format of \texttt{\emph{filename}})

\item [\texttt{-g [-{}-seed]\emph{seed}}] Initialise the random number \emph{generator} with \texttt{\emph{seed}}, a positive (long) integer value (note, if \texttt{-g} is not specified, then \CNAME\ will  generate a random number seed based on the computer clock time)

\item [\texttt{-{}-tabular}] Run with \texttt{-r} or \texttt{-f}  command to print \command{report} in tabular format (see Section \ref{sec:report-section})

\item [\texttt{-{}-single-step}] Run with \texttt{-r} to pause the model and ask the user to specify parameters and their values to use for the next iteration (see Section \ref{sec:singlestepping})

\item [\texttt{-q [-{}-query]\emph{object type}}] \emph{Query} an object type to print an extract of the object description and parameter definitions.  An object can be defined as \texttt{\emph{block.type}}, e.g. \texttt{casal2 -{}-query process.recruitment\_constant} will query the constant recruitment block.

\end{description}

\subsection{Constructing the \CNAME\ \config s \label{constructing-config}}\index{Input configuration file syntax}

The model definition, characteristics, parameters, observations, and reports are specified in \config s:

\begin{itemize}
\item Population input (Section \ref{sec:population-section}) specifies the model structure, population dynamics, and other associated parameters;
\item Estimation input (Section \ref{sec:estimation-section}) defines the objective function, parameters of the model, and the method of estimation (point estimates, Bayesian posteriors, profiles, etc.);
\item Observation input (Section \ref{sec:observation-section}) specifies the observations data used in the model and describes how the observed values should be formatted, how \CNAME\ calculates the expected values, and the likelihoods applied for each set of observations; and
\item Report input (Section \ref{sec:report-section}) specifies the output.
\end{itemize}

The command and subcommand syntax to be used in each of these configuration sections are listed in Sections \ref{sec:population-syntax} (Population), \ref{sec:estimation-syntax} (Estimation), \ref{sec:observation-syntax} (Observation) and \ref{sec:report-syntax} (Report).

\subsubsection{Commands}\index{Commands}

\CNAME\ has a range of commands that define the model structure, processes, parameters, observations, and how tasks are carried out. There are three types of commands

\begin{itemize}
\item Commands that have an argument and do not have subcommands (for example, \texttt{!include}\ \argument{\emph{filename}})
\item Commands that have a label and subcommands (for example \command{process} must have a label and has subcommands)
\item Commands that do not have either a label or argument, but have subcommands (for example \command{model})
\end{itemize}

Commands that have a label must have a unique label, i.e., the label cannot be used on more than one command of that type. The labels can contain alpha numeric characters, period (`.'), underscore (`\_') and dash (`-'). Labels must not contain whitespace (tabs or spaces) or other characters that are not letters, numbers, dash, period, or an underscore. For example,

{\small{\begin{verbatim}
@process NaturalMortality
or
!include MyModelSpecification.csl2
		\end{verbatim}}}

\subsubsection{Subcommands}\index{Commands ! Subcommands}

\CNAME\ subcommands define options and parameter values related to a particular command. Subcommands always take an argument which is one of a specific \emph{type}. The argument \emph{types} acceptable for each subcommand are defined in Section \ref{sec:syntax}, and are summarised below.

Like commands (\command{command}), subcommands and their arguments are not order specific, except that that all subcommands of a given command must appear before the next \command{command} block. \CNAME\ may report an error if they are not supplied in this way. However, in some circumstances a different order may result in a valid, but unintended, set of actions, leading to possible errors in the expected results.

The argument type for a subcommand can be\index{Subcommand argument type}:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{switch} & true/false \\
\textbf{integer}& an integer number \\
\textbf{integer vector} & a vector of integer numbers \\
\textbf{integer range} & a range of integer numbers separated by a colon, e.g. 1994:1996 is \\ & expanded to an integer vector of values (1994 1995 1996) \\
\textbf{constant} & a real number (i.e., a double) \\
\textbf{constant vector} & a vector of real numbers (i.e., a vector of doubles) \\
\textbf{estimable} & a real number that can be estimated (i.e., a double) \\
\textbf{estimable vector} & a vector of real numbers that can be estimated (i.e., a vector of doubles) \\
\textbf{addressable} & a real number that can be referenced but not estimated (i.e., an addressable double) \\
\textbf{addressable vector} & a vector of real numbers that can be referenced but not estimated (i.e., a vector of \\ & addressable doubles) \\
\textbf{string} & a categorical (string) value \\
\textbf{string vector} & a vector of categorical values.
\end{tabular}

Switches are characteristics which are either true or false. Enter \emph{true} as \argument{true} or \argument{t}, and \emph{false} as \argument{false} or \argument{f}.

Integers must be entered as whole numbers without decimal points (i.e., if \subcommand{year}\ is an integer then it is specified as \texttt{2008}, not \texttt{2008.0})

Arguments of type integer vector, constant vector, estimable vector, addressable vector, or categorical vector must contain one or more entries on a row, separated by whitespace (tabs or spaces). Arguments of type integer range must contain a colon (\texttt{:}) and no whitespace (tabs or spaces).

Parameters are defined in the population section and can be specified as estimable with the subcommand type \texttt{estimable} or \texttt{estimable vector}.  These parameters will be estimated if specified as such in the estimation section. If an estimable parameter is not specified in the estimation section it will instead be treated as a constant (or constant vector). In other words, only estimable parameters can be estimated and the parameter command must explicitly specify that the parameter is estimable with the \texttt{estimable} or \texttt{estimable vector} subcommand type.

Parameters defined as addressable with the subcommand type \texttt{addressable} or \texttt{addressable vector} are usually derived quantities and are not directly estimable. As such, they can be referenced by various processes, or have priors and/or penalties associated with them, but they do not directly contribute to any estimation within the model.

\subsubsection{The command block format}\index{Command block format}
Each command block consists of a single command which starts with the symbol \command{} and, for most commands, a unique label or an argument. Each command is then followed by its subcommands and their arguments, e.g.,

\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{description}
		\item \command{command}
		\item \subcommand{subcommand} \subcommand{argument}
		\item \subcommand{subcommand} \subcommand{argument}
		\item .
		\item .
		\item etc.
		\item \command{command} \subcommand{argument}
		\item \subcommand{subcommand} \subcommand{argument}
		\item \subcommand{subcommand} \subcommand{argument}
		\item .
		\item .
		\item etc.
		\item \command{command} \subcommand{\emph{label}}
		\item \subcommand{subcommand} \subcommand{argument}
		\item \subcommand{subcommand} \subcommand{argument}
		\item .
		\item .
		\item etc.
		\end{description}
	\end{multicols}

Blank lines are ignored, as is extra whitespace (tabs and spaces) between arguments. However, to start command block the \command{} character must be the first character on the line and must not be preceded by any whitespace. Each input file must end with a carriage return.

There is no indicator of the end of a command block. Each command block is delimited by the end of the file, the end of the section, or the start of the next command block (which is marked by the \command{} on the first character of a line). The \texttt{!include} command is the only exception to this rule (see Section \ref{sec:general-syntax}\index{command ! include files} for details of the use of \texttt{!include}).

Commands, subcommands, and arguments in the \config s are not case sensitive. However, labels and variable values are case sensitive. On Linux, filenames and paths are case sensitive (i.e., when using \texttt{!include} \argument{\emph{filename}}, the argument \argument{\emph{filename}} will be case sensitive).

\subsubsection{\I{Commenting out lines}}\index{Comments}

Text on a line that starts with the symbol \commentline\ is considered to be a comment and is ignored. To comment out a group of commands or subcommands, use \commentline\ at the beginning of each line to be ignored.

Alternatively, to comment out an entire block or section, use \commentstart\ at the beginning of a line to start the comment block, then end the block with \commentend. All lines (including line breaks) between \commentstart\ and \commentend\ inclusive are ignored.

{\small{\begin{verbatim}
		# This line is a comment and will be ignored
		@process NaturalMortality
		m 0.2
		/*
		This block of text
		is a comment and
		will be ignored
		*/
		\end{verbatim}}}

\subsubsection{Determining \CNAME\ parameter names\label{sec:parameter-names}\index{Determining parameter names}\index{Parameter names}}

When \CNAME\ processes the \config\ it translates each command block and each subcommand block into a \CNAME\ object, each with a unique parameter name. For commands, this parameter name is simply the command label. For subcommands, the parameter name format is either:

\begin{description}
\item \texttt{command[label].subcommand} if the command has a label, or
\item \texttt{command.subcommand} if the command has no label, or
\item \texttt{command[label].subcommand\{i\}} if the command has a label and the subcommand arguments are a vector, and we are accessing the  \emph{i}th element of that vector.
\item \texttt{command[label].subcommand\{i:j\}} if the command has a label, and the subcommand arguments are a vector, and we are accessing the elements from $i$ to $j$ (inclusive) of that vector.
\end{description}

The unique parameter name is used to reference that parameter when, e.g., estimating, applying a penalty, projecting, time varying, or profiling. For example, the parameter name of the Natural Mortality rates subcommand \subcommand{m} of the command \command{process} with the label \argument{NaturalMortality} is category related and so, the syntax to reference all \argument{m} related categories is

\texttt{process[NaturalMortality].m}

The syntax to specify a single category to which the natural mortality process is applied is

\texttt{process[NaturalMortality].m\{male\}}

All labels (parameter names) are user specified. As such, naming conventions are non-restrictive and can be model specific.

\subsection{\I{Single-stepping \CNAME}\label{sec:singlestepping}}\index{Single\_stepping}\index{single\_stepping section}

Single-stepping means \CNAME\ can `pause' after each year in the annual cycle during a model run, write reports, then wait and process user input of updated estimable parameters for the next year (see the command line argument \texttt{ -{}-single-step}).

This enables \CNAME\ to implement models for management simulations or scenarios that require feedback and can be used, for example, in operational management procedures (OMPs). The single-stepping process can be automated using \R, so that \CNAME\ may be used with \R\ to update input harvest values (e.g., catches from a fishery in a fisheries model) to evaluate a particular harvest control rule.

\subsection{\CNAME\ exit status values\index{Exit status value}}

When \CNAME\ is run, it will complete its task successfully or output errors. \CNAME\ will return a single exit status value 'completed' to the standard output. Error messages will be printed to the console. When input file configuration errors are found, \CNAME\ will print error messages, along with the associated filename(s) and line number(s) where the errors were identified, for example,

{\small{\begin{verbatim}
	#1: At line 15 in Reports.csl2: Parameter '{' is not supported
\end{verbatim}}}
