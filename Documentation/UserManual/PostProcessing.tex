\section{Post processing output using \R \label{sec:post-processing}}

In the downloaded bundle is a R-package that reads \CNAME\ output into R. The \CNAME\ package has one key function \texttt{extract()}.

This function will read and process \CNAME\ output files into R. 

\CNAME\ output is written so that each \command{report} will start with a `*' and end with `*end'. Users can use this format as the basis to construct R or other functions that read \CNAME\ output to identify and read individual reports for post-processing.
