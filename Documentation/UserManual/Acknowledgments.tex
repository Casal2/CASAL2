We thank the developers of CASAL \citep{1388} for their ideas that led to the development of \CNAME. The \CNAME\ logo was designed by Ian Doonan and Erika Mackay \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{(NIWA)}.

Much of the structure of \CNAME, equations, and documentation in this manual draw heavily on similar components of the fisheries population model CASAL \citep{1388} and  the spatial model SPM \citep{SPM}. We thank the authors of CASAL and SPM for their permission to use their work as the basis for parts of \CNAME\ and allow the use of the definitions, concepts, and documentation. 

The development of \CNAME\ was funded by the New Zealand \href{http://www.mpi.govt.nz}{Ministry for Primary Industries} and the \href{http://www.niwa.co.nz}{National Institute of Water \& Atmospheric Research Ltd. (NIWA)} under NIWAs Fisheries Centre Research Programme 1.
