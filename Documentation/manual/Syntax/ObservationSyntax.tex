\subsection{\I{Observation types}}

The observation types available are,

\begin{description}
  \item Observations of proportions of individuals by age class
  \item Observations of proportions of individuals between categories within each age class
  \item Relative and absolute abundance observations
  \item Relative and absolute biomass observations
\end{description}

Each type of observation requires a set of subcommands and arguments specific to that process.

\subsection{\I{Defining ageing error}}

Three methods for including ageing error into estimation with observations are,

\begin{itemize}
	\item None
	\item Normal
	\item Off-by-one
\end{itemize}

Each type of ageing error requires a set of subcommands and arguments specific to its type.
