\section{Moderating code for maintainers\label{sec:Maintaining}}

This section is for developer responsible for maintaining the GitHub repository, specifically the best way to check a pull request. When we get a pull request the things you want to scrutinize are syntax and optimisation. Why I focus on these is because the automated build system test will tell you if the unit-tests are broken so don't waste your time looking at them. Hopefully who ever is requesting a pull-request has abided by the testing framework and this won't be an issue. \textbf{This section assumes the pull request passes all test's and builds}, please be diplomatic if this is not the truth remembering that we want to encourage collaboration on this project.
