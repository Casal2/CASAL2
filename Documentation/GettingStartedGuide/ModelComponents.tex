\section{Components of a model}\label{Sec:comp}

Components of a model that are important to know before setting up a \CNAME\ model are, How many categories are in the partition, what processes occur to which categories in which order, where observations fit in to the model, and what the assumed state of the partition is before the model years run. \CNAME\ runs in yearly cycles each year is split up by time steps, So processes such as fishing and spawning seasons will have an effect on how to specify specify time steps and so will observations such as annual surveys. The next section runs through a very simple example,
