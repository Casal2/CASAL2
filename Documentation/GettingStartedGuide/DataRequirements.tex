\section{Data Requirements}\label{sec:data_requirements}

The information that is required to setup and run a \CNAME, but is by no means the end all and be all (because you can add in any functionality you wish) are;
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Catch History
	\item Time series of relative/absolute abundance/biomass
	\item Age/length compositional data
	\item Biological information (e.g. growth, maturity, life cycle)
\end{enumerate}

The Catch history and biological information are strictly the only data requirement to run a model, when I say that I mean that to run a \CNAME\ model with anthropogenic exploitation process, currently \CNAME\ requires a measure of absolute removals/mortalities. The other required data relate to running \CNAME\ in an estimation context
