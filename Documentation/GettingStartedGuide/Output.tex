\section{Analyses of output}\label{Sec:output}

An important note about \CNAME\ is that there are no default reports. That is, if no \command{report} blocks are specified, then \CNAME\ will not report any output. So check that there is at least one \command{report} block specified before running a \CNAME\ model.

\CNAME\ has an \textbf{R} library \textbf{casal2} which can read in \CNAME\ output files into \textbf{R} as a list.

There are also functions that can help pull out useful information from the data extracted by the \CNAME \ \R\ library, such SSB and objective values for model components.

{\small{\begin{verbatim}
	library(casal2)
	
	output <- extract.mpd(file = "output_file.txt", path = "/path/to/output/file")
\end{verbatim}}}
