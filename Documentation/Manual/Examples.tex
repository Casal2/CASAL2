In line declaration tips

\subsection{\I{In line declaration}\label{sec:declare}}
When you do an inline declaration the new object will be created with the name of the creator's label.$<$index$>$
where index will be the word if it's one-nine and the number if it's 10+, for example
{\small{\begin{verbatim}
@mortality halfm
selectivities [type=constant; c=1]

would create
@selectivity halfm.one
		\end{verbatim}}}

if there were 10 categories all with there own selectivity the $10^th$ selectivity would be labelled;

{\small{\begin{verbatim}
@selectivity halfm.10
\end{verbatim}}}
