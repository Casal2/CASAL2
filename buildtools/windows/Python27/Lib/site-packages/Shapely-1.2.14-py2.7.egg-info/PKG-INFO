        Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of
        planar geometric objects. It is based on the widely deployed GEOS_ (the engine
        of PostGIS_) and JTS_ (from which GEOS is ported) libraries. This C dependency
        is traded for the ability to execute with blazing speed. Shapely is not
        concerned with data formats or coordinate systems, but can be readily
        integrated with packages that are. For more details, see:

        * Shapely manual_
        * Shapely `example apps`_
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Shapely 1.2 depends on:
        
        * Python >=2.5,<3
        * libgeos_c >=3.1 (3.0 and below have not been tested, YMMV)
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Windows users should use the executable installer, which contains the required
        GEOS DLL. Other users should acquire libgeos_c by any means, make sure that it
        is on the system library path, and install from the Python package index::
        
          $ pip install Shapely
        
        or from a source distribution with the setup script::
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Here is the canonical example of building an approximately circular patch by
        buffering a point::
        
          >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
          >>> patch = Point(0.0, 0.0).buffer(10.0)
          >>> patch
          <shapely.geometry.polygon.Polygon object at 0x...>
          >>> patch.area
          313.65484905459385
        
        See the manual_ for comprehensive usage snippets and the dissolve.py and
        intersect.py `example apps`_.
        
        Integration 
        ===========
        
        Shapely does not read or write data files, but it can serialize and deserialize
        using several well known formats and protocols. The shapely.wkb and shapely.wkt
        modules provide dumpers and loaders inspired by Python's pickle module.::
        
          >>> from shapely.wkt import dumps, loads
          >>> dumps(loads('POINT (0 0)'))
          'POINT (0.0000000000000000 0.0000000000000000)'
        
        All linear objects, such as the rings of a polygon (like ``patch`` above),
        provide the Numpy array interface.::
        
          >>> from numpy import asarray
          >>> ag = asarray(patch.exterior)
          >>> ag
          array([[  1.00000000e+01,   0.00000000e+00],
                 [  9.95184727e+00,  -9.80171403e-01],
                 [  9.80785280e+00,  -1.95090322e+00],
                 ...
                 [  1.00000000e+01,   0.00000000e+00]])
        
        That yields a numpy array of [x, y] arrays. This is not always exactly what one
        wants for plotting shapes with Matplotlib (for example), so Shapely 1.2 adds
        a `xy` property for obtaining separate arrays of coordinate x and y values.::
        
          >>> x, y = patch.exterior.xy
          >>> ax = asarray(x)
          >>> ax
          array([  1.00000000e+01,   9.95184727e+00,   9.80785280e+00,  ...])
        
        Numpy arrays can also be adapted to Shapely linestrings::
        
          >>> from shapely.geometry import asLineString
          >>> asLineString(ag).length
          62.806623139095073
          >>> asLineString(ag).wkt
          'LINESTRING (10.0000000000000000 0.0000000000000000, ...)'
        
        Testing
        =======
        
        Shapely uses a Zope-stye suite of unittests and doctests, exercised via
        setup.py.::
        
          $ python setup.py test
        
        Nosetests won't run the tests properly; Zope doctest suites are not currently
        supported well by nose.
