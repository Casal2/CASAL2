The CASAL executables includes bug fixes for:
 - an issue with tagging length bins (Craig Marsh)
 - an issue with two subcommands available for 'abundance' but not available for 'relative_abundance' (Alistair Dunn)
 - a bug with the sex-specific Schnute age-length relationship, which was previously using the female-specific relationship for both males and females
 - an issue with the covariance matrix and the maximum correlation check and increasing the buffer sizes in the BetaDiff ADOL-C library
