Notes on the CASAL executables, 2022-08-05

The CASAL executables includes bug fixes for:
 - an issue with tagging length bins (Craig Marsh)
 - an issue with two subcommands available for 'abundance' but not available for 'relative_abundance' (Alistair Dunn)
 - a bug with the sex-specific Schnute age-length relationship, which was previously using the female-specific relationship for both males and females
 - an issue with the covariance matrix and the maximum correlation check
 - an issue with increasing the buffer sizes in the BetaDiff ADOL-C library to match the buffer size used by the BetaDiff ADOL-C library in Casal2
 - an issue with disease mortality being applied in the wrong timestep(s) (Craig Marsh)

The CASAL executables for versions 2.32 and newer have an additional selectivity ogive, "double_normal_stock_synthesis",
which is similar to the 6-parameter Stock Synthesis double normal ogive.
The CASAL ogive has 9 parameters, 6 that match the Stock Synthesis implementation, and 3 additional parameters for the minimum bin value ("min_x_val", for age or size),
the maximum bin value ("max_x_val", for age or size), and the bin width ("bin_width", which is usually 1 for age).
NOTE: the latter 3 parameters should have the lower and upper bounds set to the parameter values so that they are not estimated.

The Windows executable for version 2.32, casal.Rtools40.MinGW.exe, was compiled on Windows 10 with Rtools 4.0 MinGW:
https://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools40.html

The Windows executable for version 2.33, casal.Rtools42.MinGW.exe, was compiled on Windows 10 with Rtools 4.2 MinGW:
https://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html

The Linux executable for version 2.33, casal, was compiled on CentOS 7.9 with gcc 4.8.5.
