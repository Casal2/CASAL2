You have set the MCMC burn_in period at 500 samples spaced by 1000 i.e. 500000 iterations. But the stepsize is still adapting at 4e+06 iterations. You should increase the burn-in period.

MCMC settings : 
MCMC starts from a random point near the mode, using a covariance matrix which is the covariance matrix at the mode multiplied by 0.2 but this can be overridden if the user specifies a starting point using -i.
Maximum length of chain: 11000000
Length of burn-in: 500
Only samples of number evenly divisible by 1000 are recorded.
Proposal distribution is multivariate t with 2 df.
Correlations of absolute magnitude greater than 0.8 in the covariance matrix of the proposal distribution are changed to have magnitude 0.8.
Nonzero variances less than 0.0001 of the range of their parameter bounds in the covariance matrix of the proposal distribution are modified.
The initial stepsize is the default of 2.4 / sqrt(number of free parameters).
Stepsize is adjusted at iterations 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000 100000 200000 4e+06 .
