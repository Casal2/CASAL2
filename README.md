Casal2
======

Casal2 is an open-source age structured population dynamics modelling package. The Casal2 software implements a generalised age-structured population model that allows for a great deal of choice in specifying the population dynamics, parameter estimation, and model outputs. Casal2 is designed for flexibility. It can implement an age-structured model for a single population or multiple populations using user-defined categories such as area, sex, and maturity. These structural elements are generic and not predefined, and are easily constructed. Casal2 models can be used for a single population with a single anthropogenic event (in a fish population model this would be a single fishery), or for multiple species and populations, areas, and/or anthropogenic or exploitation methods, and including predator-prey interactions.

## Releases

The most recent production version of Casal2 is available [here](https://github.com/NIWAFisheriesModelling/CASAL2/releases/tag/v21.11). The production version has been checked by comparing the 6 sets of Test Case MPD and MCMC results with CASAL and generating Test Case reports. We anticipate production versions being released once or twice a year, with validation of new key functionality and fixes.

The most recent development version of Casal2 is available [here](https://github.com/NIWAFisheriesModelling/CASAL2/releases/tag/dev.202202). The development version may include updates to the Test Cases reports, and may not have undergone the same level of testing as the production versions. The development versions will made available more frequently than the production versions, as fixes and other updates are made between production releases.

More information about Casal2, including release notes and project status, is available at https://casal2.github.io.

The Casal2 user and developer forums are available on the [Casal2 Discourse site](https://casal2.discourse.group/).
