CASAL2
====

CASAL2 is an age structured population dynamics model. It implements a statistical catch-at-age population dynamics, using a discrete time-step
area-space model that represents a cohort-based population age structure. 


This repository is standalone containing all thirdparty libraries and source code necessary to compile CASAL2 v 1.0. 
As this is version 1.0, there is no guarantee from the developers that everything is perfect.


A windows bundle which includes a binary, manual, examples and other help guides can be downloaded at.
