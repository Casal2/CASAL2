CASAL2
====

CASAL2 is an age structured population dynamics model. It implements a statistical catch-at-age population dynamics, using a discrete time-step area-space model that represents a cohort-based population age structure. 


This repository is standalone containing all thirdparty libraries and source code necessary to compile CASAL2 v 1.0. As this is version 1.0, there is no guarantee from the developers that CASAL2 is error free.


A windows bundle which includes a binary, manual, examples and other help guides can be downloaded at ftp://ftp.niwa.co.nz/CASAL2/windows/Casal2.zip

For information on how to setup your system to compile CASAL2 code see the document Documentation/How To Build CASAL2.odt
