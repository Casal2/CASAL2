Casal2
======

Casal2 is an open-source age structured population dynamics modelling package. The Casal2 software implements a generalised age-structured population model that allows for a great deal of choice in specifying the population dynamics, parameter estimation, and model outputs. Casal2 is designed for flexibility. It can implement an age-structured model for a single population or multiple populations using user-defined categories such as area, sex, and maturity. These structural elements are generic and not predefined, and are easily constructed. Casal2 models can be used for a single population with a single anthropogenic event (in a fish population model this would be a single fishery), or for multiple species and populations, areas, and/or anthropogenic or exploitation methods, and including predator-prey interactions.
