Number of tagged fish at age are wrong, not sure why. Example: tagged fish in 2008. Number tagged fish in 2008 in step oneb below: model and expected.

model about 0.8% less than expected, but slightly more than expected if they had been discounted for loss rate (which they shouldn't in the first year)

Unlikely to be a selectivity issue as same difference in all age classes



2008 Tag (male+female) at step Oneb (only tagging occured).
