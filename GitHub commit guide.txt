Format for commenting commits:

1. Do not commit without a comment. This is a massive hassle for anyone trying to find the history of a file or folder. Spending ages doing manual code comparisons isn't fun.

2. The first part of each line of your commit message should indicate what time of modification you have done.

   ADD - Added a new file/class
   CHG - Modified something existing
   DEL - Removed something
   FIX - Fixed something that was broken


Examples:

An example of a bad commit message is: 
  Changed some stuff to make it better

An example of a good commit message is: 
  CHG: AgeingErrors now rebuild. This allows them to use estimables correctly.
  CHG: AgeingErrors now build the Matrix slightly differently
  CHG: Derived Quantities now rebuild for estimation
  CHG: NormalDistribution now uses a static function, no longer inherits from CBaseManager
  CHG: AgeingError Unit Tests for Observations merged into a single file.
