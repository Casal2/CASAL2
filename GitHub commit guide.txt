Format for commenting commits:

1. Verify the unit tests still pass before you commit or merge. Or you will be named and shamed.

2. Do not commit without a comment. This is a massive hassle for anyone trying to find the history of a file or folder. Spending ages doing manual code comparisons isn't fun.

3. The first part of each line of your commit message should indicate what time of modification you have done.

   ADD - Added a new file/class
   CHG - Modified something existing
   DEL - Removed something
   FIX - Fixed something that was broken


Examples:

An example of a bad commit message is: 
  Changed some stuff to make it better

An example of a good commit message is: 
  CHG: AgeingErrors now rebuild. This allows them to use Addressables correctly.
  CHG: AgeingErrors/OffbyOne now build the Matrix slightly differently see .cpp for more info
  CHG: Derived Quantities now rebuild for estimation
  CHG: NormalDistribution now uses a static function, no longer inherits from CBaseManager
  CHG: AgeingError Unit Tests for Observations merged into a single file.


When you add a new functionality please make sure you have done the following;
1. Update manual of what the functionality does and its purpose with syntax of how to implement it
2. Verified unit tests still pass!
3. Check all the unit tests have passed! and the doBuild.bat modelrunner
