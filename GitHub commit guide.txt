Format for commenting commits:

1. Do not commit without a comment. This is a massive hassle for anyone trying to find the history of a file or folder. Spending ages doing manual code comparisons isn't fun.

2. The first part of each line of your commit message should indicate what time of modification you have done.

   ADD - Added a new file/class
   CHG - Modified something existing
   DEL - Removed something
   FIX - Fixed something that was broken


Examples:

An example of a bad commit message is: 
  Changed some stuff to make it better

An example of a good commit message is: 
  CHG: AgeingErrors now rebuild. This allows them to use Addressables correctly.
  CHG: AgeingErrors/OffbyOne now build the Matrix slightly differently see .cpp for more info
  CHG: Derived Quantities now rebuild for estimation
  CHG: NormalDistribution now uses a static function, no longer inherits from CBaseManager
  CHG: AgeingError Unit Tests for Observations merged into a single file.


When you add a new functionality please make sure you have done the following;
1. Update manual of what the functionalty does and its purpose with syntax of how to implement it
2. unit tests an important aspect of Casal2 is a well validated code base
3. Check all the unit tests have passed and the doBuild.bat modelrunner
