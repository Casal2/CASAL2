$section Examples$$


$head Introduction$$
This section organizes the information related to the CppAD examples.
Each CppAD operation has its own specific example,
for example $cref add.cpp$$ is an example for
$cref/addition/ad_binary/$$.
Some of the examples are of a more general nature
(not connected of a specific feature of CppAD).
In addition, there are some utility functions that are used
by the examples.

$head Running Examples$$
The
$cref/installation instructions/Install/$$
show how the examples can be run on your system.


$head The CppAD Test Vector Template Class$$
Many of the examples use the
$small $cref/CPPAD_TESTVECTOR/testvector/$$ $$ preprocessor symbol
to determine which $cref SimpleVector$$ template class is used with
the examples.
