$head Running This Program$$
On a Unix system that includes the $code g++$$ compiler,
you can compile and run this program by changing into the
$code speed/example$$ directory and executing the following commands
$codep
	g++ -I../.. speed_program.cpp -o speed_program.exe
	./speed_program.exe
$$

$head Output$$
Executing of the program above generated the following output
(the rates will be different for each particular system):
