20130622
  cplex.c, README.cplex:  for CPLEX 12.5.1, add keyword "splitcuts"
to control use of lift-and-project cuts on MIP problems.
Also add keyword "objrep" controlling whether to replace
	minimize obj: v;
with
	minimize obj: f(x)
when variable v appears linearly in exactly one constraint of the form
	s.t. c: v >= f(x);
or
	s.t. c: v == f(x);
Default is no for the former, yes for the latter.  See README.cplex.
This requires use of version >= 20130622 of the AMPL/solver interface
library.
