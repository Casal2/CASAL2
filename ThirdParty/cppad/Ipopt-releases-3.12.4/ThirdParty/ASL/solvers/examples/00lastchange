  amplfunc.c, spamfunc.c: when there is no objective (n_obj == 0), have
	[f,c] = amplfunc(x,0)
and
	[f,c] = spamfunc(x,0)
return f = 0, and similarly have
	[g,J] = amplfunc(x,1)
and
	[g,J] = spamfunc(x,1)
return a vector of zeros for g.
  makefile.u: omit mention of spamfun4.c.
  hist.c:  behave better when the client program stops.
