20110312
  xpress.c, README.1st, README.xpress:  update to version 7.1.

20110325
  xpress.c: omit the "debug" keyword unless compiled with -DRWA_DEBUG .

20110419
  xpress.c: fix a bug with quadratic constraints involving some
variables that only appear linearly.

20110825
  xpress.c: some bug fixes, e.g., in handling quadratic forms,
supplied by David Nielsen.

20110913
  xpress.c: add support for indicator constraints, i.e., logical
constraints of the form
	s.t. foo: b == c ==> constraint1 [else constraint2]
with b a binary variable, c = 0 or 1, and the constraints simple
inequality or equality constraints.  This requires linking with
version >= 20110913 of the AMPL/solver interface library.

20111010
 xpress.c: fix a bug in the update of 20110825.

20111220
 xpress.c: increase constraint.sstatus array length by one to fix
a possible fault.

20111223
 xpress.c: catch SIGINT (control-C) and return the best available
solution.  Quickly giving several control-C's may sometimes lead to
the new solve_result_num value 520 (and no returned solution).
 README.xpress: minor adjustments.

20120417
 xpress.c: updates for XPRESS 22.

20120605
 xpress.c: add keyword mipstartvalue with synonym mipstart to
control whether a starting guess for a MIP problem is passed
to XPRESS.  Hitherto a starting guess was ignored; now the
default is to use it, but specifying mipstartvalue=0 will cause
it not to be used.  Also arrange for "xpress -v" to report the
version of XPRESS being used.

20120731
 xpress.c: updates for XPRESS 23:  new keywords cpuplatform,
preduprow, presolvemaxgrow, symmetry.  The updated driver still
works with XPRESS 22.

20121006
  Add keyword "version", to report version details before solving
the problem.

20121011
  Updates to README.xpress, makefile.u, makefile.vc and addition
of shell scripts xpress.linux and xpress.macosx.

20130129
  Correct the description of "sos2" in the "-=" output.

20130312
  Add "network" keyword instructing xpress to identify and exploit
an embedded network.

20130419
  Update for version 7.5.  New keywords: baralg, barreg, treepresolve.

20130622
  Add keyword "lazy" for recognizing suffix .lazy, with nonzero values
indicating that linear constraints are "lazy" or "delayed" if the
problem has integer variables.
  Add keyword "objrep" controlling whether to replace
	minimize obj: v;
with
	minimize obj: f(x)
when variable v appears linearly in exactly one constraint of the form
	s.t. c: v >= f(x);
or
	s.t. c: v == f(x);
Default is no for the former, yes for the latter.  For more details,
invoke "xpress -=".  This requires use of version >= 20130622 of the
AMPL/solver interface library.
