  Add keyword "lazy" for recognizing suffix .lazy, with nonzero values
indicating that linear constraints are "lazy" or "delayed" if the
problem has integer variables.
  Add keyword "objrep" controlling whether to replace
	minimize obj: v;
with
	minimize obj: f(x)
when variable v appears linearly in exactly one constraint of the form
	s.t. c: v >= f(x);
or
	s.t. c: v == f(x);
Default is no for the former, yes for the latter.  For more details,
invoke "xpress -=".  This requires use of version >= 20130622 of the
AMPL/solver interface library.
