Getting started

Firstly the developers would like to thankyou for downloading CASAL2 and remind you that this is open source, and contributions in ideas
and to source code is incouraged. This download should contain, A manual (CASAL2.pdf), an executable (casal2.exe), Source code (src), an examples folder
and 5 dynamic libraries (casal2_adolc.dll, casal2_betadiff.dll ...etc). We suggest a few steps to set up casal2 before playing with it.

The first is moving the unzipped CASAL2 folder to a convienent location, such as C:/programs

Next add the CASAL2 folder to your environment path. Because CASAL2 is a command line program this means we can open up any 
	working directory and run CASAL2 using [shift] + [right click] -> open command window here
	and type "casal2 -h" which will display the help menu.
	
If this is your first time or don't know about CASAL2 we suggest you start by reading, getting started with CASAL2.pdf.
This will explain how to run CASAL2, and the fundamental syntax for CASAL2. For a more indepth read users are recommended
to go to the manual.
