Getting started

Firstly the developers would like to thankyou for downloading CASAL2 and remind you that this is open source, and contributions in ideas
and code to the source code is incouraged. This download should contain, A manual (CASAL2.pdf), an executable (casal2.exe), Source code (src), an examples folder
and 5 dynamic libraries (casal2_adolc.dll, casal2_betadiff.dll ...etc). We suggest a few steps to set up casal2 before playing with it.

The first is moving the unzipped CASAL2 folder to a convienent location, such as C:/programs

Next add the CASAL2 folder to your environment path. Because CASAL2 is a command line program this means we can open up any 
	working directory and run CASAL2 using [shift] + [right click] -> open command window here
	and type "casal2 -h" which will display the help menu.
	
If you are unable to modify your environment path, then any location/directory that you would like to run CASAL2 must contain
the executable along with all the dynamic libraries.

Once CASAL2 is in your system path or in your working directories, you can run teh examples to see how CASAL2 works and to view the syntax of the
model configuration scripts.
