Getting started

Firstly the developers would like to thankyou for downloading CASAL2 and remind you that this is open source, and contributions in ideas
and to source code is incouraged. This download should contain, A manual (CASAL2.pdf), an executable (casal2.exe), Source code (src), an examples folder
and 5 dynamic libraries (casal2_adolc.dll, casal2_betadiff.dll ...etc).

If you are reading this then CASAL2 should be installed and appended to your systems path. To check this is true go to start menu and type cmd. This will display the comand prompt. If you type casal2, the help page should print to screen. If you see a warning
'casal2' is not a recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file. Then CASAL2 has not installed correctly.
This means manually adding the directory (where you downloaded CASAL2) to your path.

If this is your first time or don't know about CASAL2 we suggest you start by reading, getting started with CASAL2.pdf.
This will explain how to run CASAL2, and the fundamental syntax for CASAL2. For a more indepth read users are recommended
to go to the manual.
