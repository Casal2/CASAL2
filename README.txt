=====================

Thank you for downloading Casal2. 

Casal2 is a generalised age- or length-structured population 
dynamics modelling package that allows a great deal of

estimation, and model outputs. 

See the Casal2 user manuals for more information. There are 
two manuals one for age-based models (Casal2_Age.pdf) and 
another for length-based models (Casal2_Length.pdf).

Casal2 is an open source development and contributions to 
the package are encouraged.

To uninstall, use the uninstaller. This will remove any 
installed files and registry entries automatically. To

(e.g., c:\Program Files\CASAL2, but this 
depends on your choices when you installed 
the program) and any program links in your Start menu.
