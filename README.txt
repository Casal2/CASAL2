Microsoft Windows Installation
==============================

You can either

A. Use the Microsoft Windows installer for Casal2. This copies 
the program files to the install directory, creates icons in 
your start menu, and modifies the system registry to,
(i)   Add to the the Casal2 install directory to the systems 
      PATH
(ii)  Associate .csl2 files with the Casal2 icon and to open 
      with a text editor like Notepad++
(iii) Register the uninstall information required for 
      Microsoft Windows to uninstall Casal2.

Note that, depending on your system setup, you may need to 
reboot after installing to re-initialise the system PATH.

Or

B. Unzip the archive, and manually copy the Casal2 executable 
and associated *.dll files to a location of your choice. 

Note that you do need Casal2.exe and all of the *.dll files 
to successfully run Casal2.

To uninstall, use the uninstaller. This will remove any 
installed files and registry entries automatically. To 
uninstall manually, delete the files from your computer 
(typically stored in c:\Program Files\CASAL2, but this 
depends on your choices when you installed 
the program) and any program links in your Start menu.
